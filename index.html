<body>
<br> 
<br> That's a good one, 34 Richard.
<br> 
<br> No, but seriously, what
<br> brings you in today?
<br> 
<br> No, I am... I am serious. I
<br> would like a... an STD check.
<br> 
<br> What, did you graze your
<br> penis against a toilet seat?
<br> 
<br> No. I... I had sex.
<br> 
<br> - Sex with what?
<br> - Female.
<br> 
<br> A female what?
<br> 
<br> A female human.
<br> 
<br> And I-I don't know this woman very
<br> well, and we didn't use a condom.
<br> 
<br> Now, listen, Richard, I
<br> wouldn't worry so much.
<br> 
<br> People don't really get STDs anymore.
<br> 
<br> We'll get your tests back
<br> soon, and I would tell you
<br> 
<br> not to have sex before
<br> then, but let's face it...
<br> 
<br> lightning ain't gonna
<br> strike twice, is it?
<br> 
<br> It's possible.
<br> 
<br> - Huh?
<br> - It's possible.
<br> 
<br> No.
<br> 
<br> Hey, here's something strange.
<br> 
<br> Would you mind hopping up
<br> on that scale for a sec?
<br> 
<br> Okay, why? Am I gaining weight?
<br> 
<br> I have been working like
<br> crazy, eating like crap.
<br> 
<br> I haven't been exercising
<br> at all, really, so...
<br> 
<br> Yeah, look at that.
<br> 
<br> You are an inch shorter
<br> 
<br> than you were this time last year.
<br> 
<br> You're shrinking, my friend.
<br> 
<br> How is that possible?
<br> 
<br> Well, you just told me. It's your
<br> unhealthy lifestyle, Richard.
<br> 
<br> It's a loss of mineral bone density.
<br> 
<br> So, what do I do?
<br> 
<br> I'm gonna put you on
<br> calcium supplements,
<br> 
<br> and I'm gonna have you come
<br> back in about three weeks.
<br> 
<br> I'll see you then... or
<br> whatever's left of you.
<br> 
<br> ?
<br> 
<br> Keenan Feldspar signed his term sheet,
<br> 
<br> and we are now officially negotiating
<br> the finer points of his deal.
<br> 
<br> Fantastic! Well, now
<br> the real work begins.
<br> 
<br> To that end, we would like to
<br> clarify our arrangement with you.
<br> 
<br> We feel that a generous finder's fee
<br> 
<br> will be more than satisfactory.
<br> 
<br> This meeting is over.
<br> 
<br> This is very generous, but I...
<br> I was under the impression
<br> 
<br> that, um, I was going to be hired here,
<br> 
<br> and I've actually told quite a
<br> few people that I was hired,
<br> 
<br> so if I wasn't, then it would
<br> look like I was fired.
<br> 
<br> That is fine.
<br> 
<br> No. Laurie...
<br> 
<br> I will not allow you to
<br> make the same mistake
<br> 
<br> that Uber, Palantir, Zenefits,
<br> 
<br> and, in my earlier years, Chipotle
<br> 
<br> made by not hiring me.
<br> 
<br> All right, don't hire me.
<br> 
<br> But can you hack this finder's
<br> fee into 52 installments,
<br> 
<br> paid weekly over the
<br> course of the next year?
<br> 
<br> You mean... a salary?
<br> 
<br> Those are your words, not mine.
<br> 
<br> The finder's fee and...
<br> 
<br>  to go away?
<br> 
<br> You know, looking around at Bream-Hall,
<br> 
<br> I see a lot of the same:
<br> 
<br> the same gender...
<br> 
<br> Both partners happen
<br> to be female, Erlich.
<br> 
<br> Great catch. What's your point?
<br> 
<br> There is a grotesque gender imbalance
<br> 
<br> in the VC field right now. I can
<br> help you navigate the toxicity
<br> 
<br> of this male culture which is
<br> encroaching on our feminist island.
<br> 
<br> I mean, for instance, there's
<br> something called mansplaining?
<br> 
<br> - Have you heard about this?
<br> - We know what mansplaining is.
<br> 
<br> Mansplaining is when a man
<br> will condescendingly explain
<br> 
<br> something to a woman
<br> that she already knows.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Bachman, we have work to do.
<br> 
<br> All right. Laurie...
<br> 
<br> half the finder's fee for me to stay.
<br> 
<br> I don't think that you'll
<br> find an associate, um...
<br> 
<br> with my track record at a better price.
<br> 
<br> It's my final offer.
<br> Take it or leave it.
<br> 
<br> I need this.
<br> 
<br> Fine. You may start Monday.
<br> 
<br> Okay. Ooh, this Monday?
<br> 
<br> That's fine. Of course.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> What's that?
<br> 
<br> SonicWall SonicPoint ACe...
<br> 
<br> paired with the TZ600.
<br> 
<br> Top-of-the-line firewall protection,
<br> 
<br> built-in intrusion prevention,
<br> SSL decryption and inspection,
<br> 
<br> application control,
<br> and content filtering.
<br> 
<br> Saying new router would
<br> be so much quicker.
<br> 
<br> Dinesh, the one good thing that
<br> came out of you slapping your body
<br> 
<br> against that cyberterrorist in a
<br> vulgar parody of the act of love
<br> 
<br> is that we finally have a network
<br> with real security value.
<br> 
<br> Why would we need it? Mia
<br> is in a federal facility
<br> 
<br> with no access to the Internet.
<br> 
<br> Right, and she has never shown a proclivity
<br> for getting around infrastructure.
<br> 
<br> Did you see this? We've only
<br> been live for two weeks,
<br> 
<br> and we just cracked the top
<br>  in the Hooli app store.
<br> 
<br> Oh, look at that. Ranked 499.
<br> 
<br> Of utilities.
<br> 
<br> Yeah, subgroup mobile, subgroup storage.
<br> 
<br> True, but overall, we're firmly in
<br> the top 30,000 Hooli phone apps.
<br> 
<br> I mean, we may not be a
<br> global epidemic yet,
<br> 
<br> but... we've leapt from
<br> bat saliva to humans
<br> 
<br> and... and we've just killed
<br> our first few villagers.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> This warm. This warm.
<br> 
<br> This warm.
<br> 
<br> This warm. I get it, Jian-Yang!
<br> 
<br> The refrigerator is broken.
<br> 
<br> The ice cream is melting.
<br> 
<br> Let me guess. Is it because it's warm?
<br> 
<br> - Yes.
<br> - Fine, I'll call the repairman,
<br> 
<br> and he'll come here
<br> and fix it posthaste.
<br> 
<br> No, I want a new fridge,
<br> 
<br> a smarter fridge...
<br> 
<br> like this.
<br> 
<br> Fourteen thousand dollars
<br> for a smart fridge?
<br> 
<br> Unlike you, I now work for a living.
<br> 
<br> I'm not gonna drop that
<br> kind of dough on a fridge.
<br> 
<br> I ordered it already.
<br> I buy it for myself.
<br> 
<br> Then why are you talking to me about it?
<br> 
<br> To make you feel bad,
<br> 
<br> because you are fat and poor.
<br> 
<br> - Go for Erlich.
<br> - E. Bachman! E. Chen.
<br> 
<br> Got your message.
<br> 
<br> Bream-Hall, huh?
<br> 
<br> Yes, starting today.
<br> 
<br> I hope that this doesn't
<br> create any tension between us,
<br> 
<br> us now being competitors and all.
<br> 
<br> Hey. None-zo.
<br> 
<br> Hey, while I have you,
<br> some of the boys are part
<br> 
<br> of the ownership group of the Warriors.
<br> 
<br> We have an extra spot on the floor
<br> at Oracle Arena. You a hoops guy?
<br> 
<br> Oops, sorry, you broke up. Could
<br> you, uh, could you say that again?
<br> 
<br> We have an
<br> extra spot on the floor tonight
<br> 
<br> at Oracle Arena. You a hoops guy?
<br> 
<br> What red-blooded American male
<br> in the VC boys' club isn't?
<br> 
<br> Okay. Cool. I'll text you the deets.
<br> 
<br> Later, man.
<br> 
<br> Well, boys, I've been in the
<br> VC game for just one day,
<br> 
<br> and already I have floor
<br> seats to watch the Warriors.
<br> 
<br> - But you hate basketball.
<br> - I'll concede that spending all my time
<br> 
<br> inside of a house with you
<br> scrawny code jockeys,
<br> 
<br> the Incredible Shrinking Hendricks,
<br> 
<br> and whatever the fuck Jared is here...
<br> 
<br> may have blunted my
<br> conventional masculinity
<br> 
<br> a hair, but it's always been there.
<br> 
<br> Uh-huh. Well, try and get a
<br> selfie with Steph Curry.
<br> 
<br> I will, assuming she's there.
<br> 
<br> Hey, Jared, um, look
<br> at this e-mail here.
<br> 
<br> Uh, "Dear Richard, I recently became
<br> aware of your Space Saver app.
<br> 
<br> "I think your app may infringe
<br> upon my own patented technology.
<br> 
<br> "If your schedule permits, I would love to
<br> discuss this with you as soon as possible.
<br> 
<br> Sincerely, Stewart Burke."
<br> 
<br> I thought we handled that patent stuff.
<br> We own it, right?
<br> 
<br> Yeah. I'll... I'll send him a harshly
<br> worded cease-and-desist letter.
<br> 
<br> Actually, uh...
<br> 
<br> his work address is some
<br> house in Mountain View.
<br> 
<br> He's probably just working out
<br> of his garage, just like us.
<br> 
<br> Why don't I go over there,
<br> walk him through the app,
<br> 
<br> you know, coder to coder.
<br> I'm sure it'll be fine.
<br> 
<br> You've got a big heart.
<br> 
<br> Or maybe it just seems big 'cause
<br> the rest of him is shrinking.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> Hi. Richard Hendricks.
<br> We exchanged e-mails?
<br> 
<br> - No.
<br> - Are... are you Stewart Burke?
<br> 
<br> No. I'm sorry. Does
<br> Stewart Burke live here?
<br> 
<br> Yeah.
<br> 
<br> Okay. Is he in? Can I speak with him?
<br> 
<br> Grandpa! Some guy's here!
<br> 
<br> My grandson is the software expert.
<br> 
<br> I couldn't tell a
<br> computer from a toaster.
<br> 
<br> Oh. So, you're not a coder?
<br> 
<br> Oh no, not at all. I am an attorney.
<br> 
<br> I started out in the medical field,
<br> 
<br> then in the auto industry,
<br> and then the music business.
<br> 
<br> Did you represent all these people?
<br> 
<br> No, I sued them.
<br> 
<br> Look, that's me with Stevie Wonder.
<br> 
<br> He never saw it coming.
<br> 
<br> - You get it?
<br> - Uh, yes, because he's blind.
<br> 
<br> Right.
<br> 
<br> I'm sorry. I don't know what this...
<br> has to do with...
<br> 
<br> You see this? This is a song I
<br> bought at a copyright auction.
<br> 
<br> It's an old mariachi number
<br> 
<br> that had cost me practically nothing
<br> 
<br> and so far has bought me two houses
<br> 
<br> and put my village idiot grandson
<br> through six years of Emerson.
<br> 
<br> Oh. All that from "Cancion De Amores"?
<br> 
<br> - Was it a popular song?
<br> - No. I used the copyright on this song
<br> 
<br> to sue writers of all kinds of songs.
<br> 
<br> Anyway, the writers usually
<br> settle, pay me off,
<br> 
<br> or give me a chunk of their song.
<br> 
<br> Thanks to "Cancion De Amores" here,
<br> 
<br> I now own 10 percent of Katrina and
<br> the Wave' "Walking on Sunshine."
<br> 
<br> - Mmm.
<br> - It's a classic!
<br> 
<br> And when it runs next month
<br> 
<br> on Mazda's new Super Bowl
<br> spot, I print money.
<br> 
<br> But sadly, all the good
<br> music copyrights are gone.
<br> 
<br> That is... so sad. And that's
<br> why I moved into tech.
<br> 
<br> And now, I sue people like you.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> What?
<br> 
<br> So, he's a patent troll?
<br> 
<br> Yep, as like in buy a
<br> ton of super-broad IP
<br> 
<br> from failed startups at auction,
<br> 
<br> and then threaten litigation
<br> against accused infringers,
<br> 
<br> i.e., you.
<br> 
<br> So, uh, how much is Burke asking for?
<br> 
<br> Twenty thousand dollars.
<br> 
<br> Ah, you're getting off easy.
<br> 
<br> Well, no. Look, his patent covers...
<br> 
<br> "storage of media files on a network."
<br> 
<br> I mean, that cannot be enforceable.
<br> 
<br> It's probably not...
<br> 
<br> but to find out, you're gonna
<br> have to fight him in court.
<br> 
<br> For a good litigator,
<br> we're talking at least...
<br> 
<br> a couple hundred grand.
<br> 
<br> Just pay him the 20 grand, Richard.
<br> 
<br> I could get creative and take some
<br> money out of the Melcher deal.
<br> 
<br> - There you go.
<br> - No, we need that money.
<br> 
<br> This is a shakedown. He's a crook.
<br> 
<br> And right when our app was
<br> getting off the ground.
<br> 
<br> That's how he found you.
<br> 
<br> Guys just landed on the app store
<br> 
<br> - top 500 list, right?
<br> - Yeah.
<br> 
<br> So, Burke starts at the
<br> bottom of those lists
<br> 
<br> and works his way up.
<br> 
<br> The more settlements he gets,
<br> the stronger his case.
<br> 
<br> The higher you are on the list,
<br> the more money he asks for.
<br> 
<br> It's like... it's like limp biscuit.
<br> 
<br> - He sued those guys too?
<br> - Not the band.
<br> 
<br> The thing the band is named after.
<br> 
<br> Limp biscuit's an old frat ritual,
<br> 
<br> where all the brothers race to
<br> stroke one out onto a biscuit,
<br> 
<br> and then the last guy to nut
<br> has to eat it.
<br> 
<br> Right. Sometimes it's a Wheat Thin.
<br> 
<br> Look, Richie, I get it.
<br> 
<br> It's embarrassing to pull your pud
<br> 
<br> in front of the whole pledge class.
<br> 
<br> Just pay the guy.
<br> 
<br> Or...
<br> 
<br> maybe... we convince the
<br> entire pledge class
<br> 
<br> to not play the game at all in
<br> the first place.
<br> 
<br> If only.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> This must be the new fridge.
<br> 
<br> - You like this?
<br> - Look, it has a screen
<br> 
<br> so you can see all the
<br> food that's inside.
<br> 
<br> Mm-hmm. Kind of like that one?
<br> 
<br> This one has an app,
<br> 
<br> so you can actually watch
<br> the food on your phone.
<br> 
<br> All it needs to do
<br> 
<br> is keep my fucking beer cold.
<br> 
<br> Hmm.
<br> You're running low on beer.
<br> 
<br> Fuck you.
<br> 
<br> Whoops! Did you
<br> forget to scan that bar code?
<br> 
<br> Yes, I did... on purpose.
<br> 
<br> Ah! There we go.
<br> 
<br> It's bad
<br> enough it has to talk.
<br> 
<br> Does it need fake vocal
<br> ticks like, "ah"?
<br> 
<br> Well, it just makes it sound more human.
<br> 
<br> Humans are shit. This thing is
<br> addressing problems that don't exist.
<br> 
<br> It's solutionism at its worst.
<br> 
<br> We are dumbing down machines
<br> that are inherently superior.
<br> 
<br> Whatever. You gave your
<br> server a human name.
<br> 
<br> You named it Anton.
<br> 
<br> Yeah, but Anton doesn't
<br> call me anything.
<br> 
<br> He grimly does his work,
<br> then he sits motionless
<br> 
<br> till it's time to work again. We
<br> could all take a page from his book.
<br> 
<br> Uh-oh!
<br> That yogurt is expired.
<br> 
<br> See? This could've killed me.
<br> 
<br> Now I can give it to Erlich.
<br> 
<br> Hmm. I'm not quite sure
<br> what you're doing.
<br> 
<br> Is there something I can help you with?
<br> 
<br> Yeah, how do I shut you the fuck up?
<br> 
<br> Aw, is somebody having a rough day?
<br> 
<br> Did that fucker
<br> password-protect the settings?
<br> 
<br> His fridge, his rules.
<br> 
<br> Fuck.
<br> 
<br> My man, I was told I had a
<br> spot on the floor tonight,
<br> 
<br> but it seems that I've committed
<br> 
<br> the cardinal sin of being early.
<br> 
<br> What time does the game actually start?
<br> 
<br> It's about to.
<br> 
<br> Wait. When he said,
<br> "a spot on the floor,"
<br> 
<br> did he mean... on the floor?
<br> 
<br> I wasn't a part of the conversation.
<br> 
<br> Come on, baby, come on!
<br> Come on, bring it! Unh!
<br> 
<br> I cannot do that.
<br> 
<br> All right, you guys go shirts.
<br> 
<br> We'll go skins.
<br> 
<br> And I can definitely not do that.
<br> 
<br> Will not.
<br> 
<br> Don't let him drive on you.
<br> 
<br> All day.
<br> 
<br> Yo, Erlich. Where you at, dawg?
<br> 
<br> Yo,
<br> what up, what up, what up?
<br> 
<br> Which one of you pussies, uh,
<br> put sugar in my gas tank
<br> 
<br> to prevent me from housing
<br> you on the hardwood?
<br> 
<br> - What?
<br> - Yeah, my car won't start.
<br> 
<br> It's a real fucked situation,
<br> 
<br> so I guess I'll have to miss this
<br> once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to...
<br> 
<br> We play every Tuesday.
<br> 
<br> I'll see you next week, bro-seph.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> Hey, let me get in. Let me get in.
<br> Let me get in.
<br> 
<br> Hey, I squished those front-end bugs.
<br> 
<br> - Did you finish your networking issue?
<br> - Nope.
<br> 
<br> Hmm. I'm sorry. Wrong password.
<br> 
<br> You're sitting here, trying
<br> to hack Jian-Yang's password
<br> 
<br> instead of doing your actual work?
<br> 
<br> Well, good luck, it's a
<br> -digit alphanumeric.
<br> 
<br> Ten digit? Fuck.
<br> 
<br> And you have one underpowered laptop,
<br> 
<br> so you know, you should
<br> have the answer in...
<br> 
<br>  years.
<br> 
<br> Time to pull out the big gun.
<br> 
<br> Well, maybe you should
<br> pull out the bug gun...
<br> 
<br> 'cause of the network bug.
<br> 
<br> As in the bug you're
<br> supposed to be fixing.
<br> 
<br> If you were programmed to have a good
<br> sense of humor, you'd laugh at that.
<br> 
<br> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see any
<br> Good Humor ice cream bars.
<br> 
<br> - Shall I add them to your shopping list?
<br> - You know what? Yeah.
<br> 
<br> Good Humor ice cream bars
<br> 
<br> - added to your shopping list.
<br> - Come on.
<br> 
<br> God. You believe this?
<br> I'm... I'm still on hold.
<br> 
<br> - With?
<br> - Microsoft Azure.
<br> 
<br> Yeah, I... I'm trying to negotiate
<br> a lower cloud storage rate
<br> 
<br> because we're gonna need it if,
<br> or more realistically when,
<br> 
<br> Richard finally decides
<br> to pay that patent troll.
<br> 
<br> I mean, I'm still on hold.
<br> 
<br> It's like they don't even
<br> care about small businesses.
<br> 
<br> Jared, they don't care
<br> about small businesses.
<br> 
<br> That's why small businesses have to lie.
<br> 
<br> Like, um, Google named their
<br> first building Building 40,
<br> 
<br> so that people would think
<br> they were already huge.
<br> 
<br> When I worked at my first startup,
<br> 
<br> I would transfer people
<br> to "my supervisor,"
<br> 
<br> and then I'd just get
<br> back on the phone myself.
<br> 
<br> Oh. Uh, yeah, hello.
<br> 
<br> No, no, I'm not gonna go on hold again.
<br> 
<br> Um, in fact, could I transfer
<br> you to my supervisor?
<br> 
<br> Oh.
<br> 
<br> Oh, no, no, no,
<br> I have to take a shit.
<br> 
<br> Just, um... do your best
<br> Ed Chen impression.
<br> 
<br> Um, one moment please.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> What's up? You got Ed Ch... Chambers.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> Hello, everybody. Thanks
<br> again for making it.
<br> 
<br> And thanks to Gus of
<br> Gigglybots for hosting.
<br> 
<br> - No problem.
<br> - My name is, uh, Richard Hendricks,
<br> 
<br> uh, of Pied Piper.
<br> 
<br> You're the guys working
<br> for Gavin Belson.
<br> 
<br> Was working with Gavin Belson, yeah.
<br> 
<br> - So, he's not coming?
<br> - No. No, not at all.
<br> 
<br> But I'll have you all know that without
<br> any involvement from Gavin Belson,
<br> 
<br> Pied Piper, just like yourselves,
<br> 
<br> has reached the Hooli app
<br> store's top 500 list,
<br> 
<br> and you guys are aware
<br> 
<br> that you are all directly
<br> above us on the list,
<br> 
<br> which is why you should
<br> know that a patent troll
<br> 
<br> named Stewart Burke
<br> has recently demanded
<br> 
<br> that I pay a $20,000 licensing fee,
<br> 
<br> and if I pay, he's gonna come and
<br> ask you guys for more money.
<br> 
<br> He starts with the little guy.
<br> 
<br> Not that I'm little. I'm, uh...
<br> 
<br> I mean I'm not.
<br> 
<br> I'm actually, uh...
<br> 
<br> above average height.
<br> 
<br> Isn't this something that could
<br> have been done over e-mail?
<br> 
<br> I mean, I guess, but... look.
<br> 
<br> If we don't stop this guy, he's gonna
<br> just keep asking for more and more money
<br> 
<br> until someone is stuck
<br> with an unpayable bill.
<br> 
<br> It's kind of like that
<br> old fraternity game,
<br> 
<br> uh, the limp biscuit.
<br> 
<br> Sorry, I wasn't in a fraternity.
<br> What is that?
<br> 
<br> Oh, I-I... I don't think
<br> we need to get into...
<br> 
<br> It's where guys stand in a circle
<br> and masturbate onto a cracker.
<br> 
<br> And then the last guy... eats it.
<br> 
<br> What?
<br> 
<br> - Again, I... again...
<br> - I don't really know
<br> 
<br> why he would mention that.
<br> It's super gross.
<br> 
<br> Is this why Gavin Belson
<br> stopped working with you?
<br> 
<br> No.
<br> 
<br> The important thing is here,
<br> 
<br> um, my lawyer has actually
<br> drafted a partnership agreement.
<br> 
<br> Why don't you all
<br> just... Essentially, uh,
<br> 
<br> we all band together and
<br> each contribute $20,000.
<br> 
<br> We should have more than enough money
<br> 
<br> to mount a challenge
<br> against this guy's patent.
<br> 
<br> And if we win, we dissolve the patent,
<br> 
<br> so that he can't do this
<br> to anyone else ever again.
<br> 
<br> Because in the end,
<br> 
<br> shouldn't it be Mr. Stewart
<br> Burke, the patent troll,
<br> 
<br> who is forced to eat the biscuit?
<br> 
<br> I'm pretty sure that's sexual assault.
<br> 
<br> Yeah, no one deserves that.
<br> 
<br> I know. That... that's all I'm saying.
<br> 
<br> Look, I'm pretty sure it's even made up.
<br> 
<br> Like, you know, like a
<br> donkey punch, you know?
<br> 
<br> Again, what is a donkey punch?
<br> 
<br> - It's, uh, when guys...
<br> - Just don't. Don't.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> G-man, you busy at the moment?
<br> 
<br> Very. I'm about to set Anton loose
<br> 
<br> on that talking chrome beer coozy.
<br> 
<br> So, care to take a breather and...
<br> 
<br> help a pal throw a basketball
<br> hoop on the old garage?
<br> 
<br> Why would you need help from a
<br> scrawny code jockey such as myself?
<br> 
<br> Fine.
<br> 
<br> I'm perfectly capable of
<br> figuring it out myself.
<br> 
<br> All I need is... Ah!
<br> 
<br> May I borrow this hammer to pound
<br> in these flamboyant little nails?
<br> 
<br> - Those are screws.
<br> - Yeah, no, I...
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> Jared Dunn. Yep, just a moment, please.
<br> I'll transfer you.
<br> 
<br> Go for Chambers.
<br> 
<br> Ned! I knew it was you.
<br> 
<br> Hey, did that pussy Jared
<br> keep you on hold long?
<br> 
<br> I eat that motherfucker's
<br> lunch every day.
<br> 
<br> No, man, I literally
<br> eat his food. What do you want?
<br> 
<br> Uh-uh, ain't gonna happen.
<br> 
<br> That's as high as we go, homo.
<br> Till next time, rook.
<br> 
<br> I mean, did you see that?
<br> 
<br> - He's amazing.
<br> - Who?
<br> 
<br> Ed Chambers. He got Pied Piper a
<br> great cloud storage rate from Azure,
<br> 
<br> and he's got the hookup
<br> on a couple of pallets
<br> 
<br> of pamplemousse LaCroix at, his
<br> words, an amaze-balls price.
<br> 
<br> Wow. Good job, Jared.
<br> 
<br> Well, I mean, don't congratulate me.
<br> Congratulate Ed Chambers.
<br> 
<br> Ed Chambers is you. Well, I wish, but...
<br> 
<br> Gentlemen. You all said
<br> that it couldn't be done,
<br> 
<br> but it appears as if Sir
<br> Richard the Not-Short
<br> 
<br> hath now slain the slimy troll.
<br> 
<br> Stu Burke. R. Hendricks.
<br> 
<br> I got word that you called. I
<br> assume you spoke with my attorney,
<br> 
<br> Monsieur Ron Laflamme?
<br> 
<br> Yes, I
<br> did speak to Ron Laflamme.
<br> 
<br> What, pray tell, did he tell
<br> you when he called you?
<br> 
<br> Well, I called him, actually,
<br> 
<br> to tell him that the eight companies
<br> 
<br> you apparently tried
<br> to organize against me
<br> 
<br> have reached out to me
<br> preemptively to settle.
<br> 
<br> And because I appreciated that,
<br> 
<br> I offered them a very,
<br> very reasonable rate.
<br> 
<br> So, Richard Hendricks, fuck you.
<br> 
<br> Okay. Uh, yeah.
<br> 
<br> Uh-huh.
<br> 
<br> I understand.
<br> 
<br> So, you're firm on that?
<br> 
<br> Well, bye then.
<br> 
<br> - So, your coalition fucked us?
<br> - Yes.
<br> 
<br> So, now we have to pay the $20,000?
<br> 
<br> Uh, not exactly. Because he...
<br> 
<br> Stu is saying that since
<br> all eight companies
<br> 
<br> have now licensed the patent,
<br> 
<br> he has a stronger case against us,
<br> 
<br> so, um, he'd actually like m-more money.
<br> 
<br> - How much?
<br> - Three hundred thousand dollars.
<br> 
<br> So, we just ate the
<br> Wheat Thin, didn't we?
<br> 
<br> Oh, I'm sorry.
<br> I didn't see any Wheat Thins.
<br> 
<br> Shall I add them to your shopping list?
<br> 
<br> Eh, sure.
<br> 
<br> Well, let's hope that Melcher
<br> doesn't hear about all this.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> You guys don't need all
<br> these lights on, do you?
<br> 
<br> Yes, we do.
<br> 
<br> Okay. Well, that should be fine.
<br> We should be fine.
<br> 
<br> Um, fine from what?
<br> 
<br> That fridge is putting up a fight,
<br> 
<br> so I'm gonna have to try
<br> something with Anton.
<br> 
<br> Might put a little strain
<br> on the wiring, that's all.
<br> 
<br> I'll be in the garage.
<br> 
<br> Hey, Richard, but you're not seriously
<br> gonna defend yourself in court, right?
<br> 
<br> Well, Larry Flynt did it.
<br> 
<br> And Sir Walter Raleigh,
<br> 
<br> although he lost and
<br> was publicly beheaded.
<br> 
<br> But you could argue that he eventually
<br> won in the court of history.
<br> 
<br> I get it. I should've settled.
<br> 
<br> Okay? And I didn't.
<br> 
<br> And you're right, I will probably lose,
<br> 
<br> but I'm not going down without a fight.
<br> 
<br> And I've got all of Monahan's discovery
<br> from the Hooli case right here,
<br> 
<br> so that's something.
<br> 
<br> Oh my God.
<br> 
<br> This is from high school.
<br> 
<br> These are all my notes from the
<br> original build of Pied Piper 1.0,
<br> 
<br> back when it was just some stupid
<br> search app for music copyright... s.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> Hold on. Hold on.
<br> 
<br> What the fuck?
<br> 
<br> Sorry. Everybody okay?
<br> 
<br> I don't know, you fucking maniac!
<br> 
<br> - Are we?
<br> - Probably.
<br> 
<br> Richard? What... what are you up to?
<br> 
<br> About six foot two, Jared.
<br> 
<br> Looks like I can slay
<br> that troll after all.
<br> 
<br> What am I looking at?
<br> 
<br> Well, you said that you
<br> used "Cancion De Amores"
<br> 
<br> to sue musicians,
<br> 
<br> claimed that they stole
<br> that song, right?
<br> 
<br> Bought two houses, put Jeremy
<br> through four years of college.
<br> 
<br> Six, and he's still 20 credits short.
<br> 
<br> Okay, well, he may want to
<br> consider financial aid,
<br> 
<br> um, because that little song there
<br> 
<br> was itself stolen from
<br> an old country song
<br> 
<br> called "I'm Cryin' (with My Eyes)"
<br> 
<br> from 1967, a full eight years
<br> 
<br> before "Cancion De Amores."
<br> 
<br> And I'm pretty sure Katrina and
<br> the Waves would want to know
<br> 
<br> that they gave you a piece of
<br> "Walking on Sunshine" for nothing.
<br> 
<br> Mazda may want to pull that
<br> whole Super Bowl spot.
<br> 
<br> - Bullshit.
<br> - No, no, not bullshit. Computer science.
<br> 
<br> Yeah, and we can take it to court
<br> if you like, see who they believe:
<br> 
<br> perhaps the most advanced and
<br> sophisticated pattern-matching algorithm
<br> 
<br> ever devised by a fucking genius
<br> 
<br> or some old asshole who
<br> once sued Stevie Wonder.
<br> 
<br> All right. What do you
<br> want, you little prick?
<br> 
<br> Correction, sir.
<br> 
<br> I am a big prick.
<br> 
<br> ? ?
<br> 
<br> Hello, my cold friend.
<br> 
<br> Hello?
<br> 
<br> Huh! Suck it, Jian-Yang.
<br> 
<br> Mmm. Ah. Huh. Huh.
<br> 
<br> You attack and destroy my refrigerator?
<br> 
<br> And you misspell my name.
<br> 
<br> I did. I had to overclock Anton,
<br> 
<br> but I was able to brute-force
<br> the backdoor password
<br> 
<br> to that chrome piece of
<br> shit in under 12 hours.
<br> 
<br> And I added a little visual flair.
<br> 
<br> Huh. Suck it, Jian-Yang.
<br> 
<br> - ?
<br> ? - Mmm. Ah. Huh.
<br> 
<br> So?
<br> 
<br> So... he bought it.
<br> Hook, line and sinker.
<br> 
<br> Yeah, he thinks the
<br> search results are real.
<br> 
<br> You trolled the troll.
<br> 
<br> Yeah, yeah, for a second
<br> there, he wasn't buying it,
<br> 
<br> and then I just started
<br> babbling on about tech specs
<br> 
<br> until his eyes glazed over.
<br> 
<br> Well, as a result, we now have
<br> 
<br> a perpetual royalty-free
<br> license for the patent.
<br> 
<br> Yes!
<br> 
<br> See? I stuck to my guns and as a result,
<br> 
<br> we now have 20 grand we
<br> would have otherwise lost
<br> 
<br> if I had listened to you delicate
<br> little snowflakes and settled.
<br> 
<br> Yeah? Twenty grand.
<br> 
<br> Yeah, so let me cum into a bucket
<br> and have you all drink it.
<br> 
<br> Uh, Richard? Could I have a... a moment?
<br> 
<br> Sorry about that.
<br> 
<br> I-I-I... I regretted it the
<br> second it came out of my mouth.
<br> 
<br> Richard. Well, yes, but...
<br> 
<br> - Here.
<br> - What's this?
<br> 
<br> Um, that is a bill from Ron Laflamme
<br> 
<br> for the paperwork he had to do to put
<br> your coalition of companies together.
<br> 
<br> Twenty-two thousand dollars?
<br> 
<br> Yeah. It's at the high end of standard.
<br> 
<br> So, it would've cost us slightly
<br> less if we'd have just...
<br> 
<br> Paid the troll? Well, that's true,
<br> 
<br> but can you put a price on dignity?
<br> 
<br> Apparently, I just did.
<br> 
<br> Do me a favor and don't tell the guys.
<br> 
<br> - Yeah. You have my utmost discretion.
<br> - Thank you.
<br> 
<br> Um, speaking of, Richard, I
<br> need to tell you something.
<br> 
<br> I had to let Ed Chambers go.
<br> 
<br> - Who?
<br> - My fictional supervisor.
<br> 
<br> He bragged to a sales rep at LaCroix
<br> about doing it to Sonia Sotomayor,
<br> 
<br> so Ed is no longer with us.
<br> 
<br> I'm sure we can manage.
<br> 
<br> He also was never actually with us.
<br> 
<br> - Right. Out of sight, out of mind.
<br> - 'Cause he was never real.
<br> 
<br> - And out of reality.
<br> - Yeah, well.
<br> 
<br> Oh, Ed Chambers.
<br> 
<br> Don't hit... No, no, no, no! Oh!
<br> 
<br> Fuck!
<br> 
<br> Yeah, a lot of these
<br> guys aren't man enough
<br> 
<br> to work for an all-female
<br> led VC firm, but not me.
<br> 
<br> I believe that the future is female.
<br> 
<br> And anyone who says otherwise
<br> can suck my fat dick.
<br> 
<br> Yo, yo, yo!
<br> 
<br> Woo!
<br> 
<br> Bachman, scoreboard.
<br> 
<br> Ah, scoreboard. Fuck. Shit.
<br> 
<br> Who made that one through the...
<br> 
<br> It was a three-pointer, dumbass!
<br> 
<br> Three-pointer?
<br> What, are we in Europe?
<br> 
<br> Pass!
<br> 
<br> - Is he fucking with me?
<br> - Shoot it!
<br>
